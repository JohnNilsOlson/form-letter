      <p>Dear <span class="firstname"></span>,<br>
      <br>
      Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Now then, let's play. Son of a gun. Every time you practice, you learn more. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.

      When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Very easy to work these to death. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. We can fix anything. I like to beat the brush. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. 
      <br>
      <br>
      This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make these big decisions. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Let's do that again. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.
      <br>
      <br>
      All the best,<br>
